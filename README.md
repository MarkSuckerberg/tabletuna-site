# Tabletuna Character Creation Tools

This webapp aims to make the process of creating a character for the fan-made [Cosmosdex-inspired](https://cosmosdex.com/) tabletop, [Tabletuna](https://hackmd.io/@Honk/rkjfYWCrK), much more fun and easy to do.

There are plans for expanding into different systems, but currently the project is entirely focused on Tabletuna.
